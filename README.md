IKEA
====

IKEA, the infamous land of the billy bookcase and the unpronouncable table-lamp. Also cinammon buns. mmmm....

Now you too can generate your own IKEA products, with the revolutionary new tool ikea.py

Simply choose the amount of sharply-designed scandinavian items of furniture you desire and run the code.

How to use this tool:

   Run ikea.py in the interactive shell
   
   Call this code:
   
      getIkeaProducts(n)
   
   Enjoy the endless different permutations that this program's inbuilt SDNN* can create at your desire

Once you've realised the benifits of this tool to revolutionise your workflow, you can deposit the files into your Python directory so you can simply `import ikea` to get more art-deco table lamps in your project.
